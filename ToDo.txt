"The Talisman" Features to be implemented/improved upon

Features:
[x] Card Movement script:
						- With smooth linear interpolation based off of player's framerate.
						- Confined within the boundary of the camera
[ ] Basic board design:
						- A board layout with defined areas to 'drop' cards into play
						- Must be symmetrical and even for both players
[ ] CardObject:
						- Create the CardObject hierarchy to be the common parent for all cards
						- Will have shared components: Cost, Name, Description, SpriteRenderer
						- Perhaps make a prefab for it
[ ] CardObject interaction script:
						- Include generic behaviours for clicking a CardObject in play.
						- Able to select another CardObject as a target
[ ] Board 'drop zone' script:
						- Allow a zone to transform a Card into its corresponding CardObject
						- If a zone already has a CardObject, prevent another card from taking over its space
[ ] Card to Board interaction:
						- Placing a card in and open spot will spawn an object of its type (if applicable)

Improvements:
[ ] Enhanced Card Movement script:
						- Have the card 'tilt' as you move it around
						- Clip the distance it can be away from your mouse
[ ] Multiplayer Networking:
						- This will take a lot of research and thinking...
